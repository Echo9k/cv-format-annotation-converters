pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ cvannotate
```

## 🔧 Next Steps for You

### 1. Set up GitHub Environments

Go to your GitHub repository settings and create these environments:

**Step by step:**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** → **Environments** (left sidebar)
3. Click **New environment**

**Environment 1: `test-pypi`**
- Name: `test-pypi`
- No protection rules needed
- Add your `PYPI` secret to this environment

**Environment 2: `production`**
- Name: `production`
- Add protection rule: **Required reviewers** (add yourself)
- Add protection rule: **Restrict pushes to protected branches**
- Add your `PYPI` secret to this environment

### 2. Update Repository Badges in README

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` in these files with your actual GitHub username:
- `README.md` (lines with badge URLs)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (clone URL)

For example, if your username is `johndoe`, change:
```
https://github.com/Echo9k/cv-format-annotation-converters
```

### 3. Test the Pipeline

**Option A: Create a Pull Request**
```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b test-pipeline

# Make a small change (like updating README)
echo "Testing CI pipeline" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: trigger CI pipeline"
git push origin test-pipeline

# Create PR from GitHub UI
```

**Option B: Test with Git Commands**
```bash
# Check current git status
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "feat: setup complete CI/CD pipeline"

# Push to main (will trigger CI)
git push origin main
```

### 4. Test PyPI Deployment

Once your environments are set up:

**Test PyPI (automatic on develop branch):**
```bash
git checkout -b develop
git push origin develop
# This will trigger deployment to Test PyPI
```

**Production PyPI (automatic on version tags):**
```bash
# Update version in pyproject.toml first
git tag v0.1.1
git push origin v0.1.1
# This will trigger deployment to Production PyPI
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

After completing these steps:

1. **Pull Requests** will trigger:
   - ✅ Multi-Python testing (3.8-3.12)
   - ✅ Code quality checks (flake8, black, isort)
   - ✅ Security scanning (safety, bandit)
   - ✅ Package validation

2. **Push to develop** will trigger:
   - ✅ All CI checks above
   - ✅ Deployment to Test PyPI

3. **Version tags** (`v*`) will trigger:
   - ✅ All CI checks above
   - ✅ Deployment to Production PyPI
   - ✅ GitHub release creation

## 🔍 Monitoring

- **Actions tab**: Monitor workflow runs
- **Environments**: Check deployment status
- **PyPI**: Verify package uploads

Your package is now ready for professional CI/CD! 🚀
