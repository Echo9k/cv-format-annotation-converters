## ✅ Maintained Separation of Concerns

### Build & CI/CD
- `scripts/build-conda-ci.sh` - Used in GitHub Actions
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Updated to use new paths

### Testing & Validation
- All test scripts preserved in `scripts/` directory
- Enhanced with documentation headers
- Purpose-built for pre-push validation

### Documentation
- **User-focused**: `README.md`
- **Developer-focused**: `DEVELOPMENT.md` 
- **Conda-specific**: `CONDA.md`
- **Contributor-focused**: `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## 🛠️ Improvements Made

### Script Organization
- Clear directory structure with `scripts/` folder
- Comprehensive documentation in `scripts/README.md`
- Enhanced script headers explaining purpose and usage

### CI/CD Updates
- Updated GitHub Actions to use `scripts/build-conda-ci.sh`
- Modernized all action versions (setup-python@v5, cache@v4, etc.)
- Maintained robust error handling and logging

### Documentation Consolidation
- Merged overlapping documentation into focused guides
- Reduced documentation sprawl from 8+ files to 4 core files
- Maintained all essential information

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

### Cleaner Codebase
- Removed 15+ deprecated/duplicate files
- Organized 8 utility scripts into dedicated directory
- Clear separation between user and developer documentation

### Maintained Functionality
- All validation scripts preserved and working
- CI/CD pipeline paths updated correctly
- Pre-push validation workflow intact

### Better Developer Experience
- Clear script documentation with usage examples
- Organized development workflow in `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Focused conda documentation in `CONDA.md`

## 🚀 Ready for Development

The codebase now has:
- ✅ Sharper focus with reduced file count
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Comprehensive pre-push validation
- ✅ Clear documentation structure
- ✅ Updated CI/CD integration

**Next Steps**: The organized codebase is ready for continued development and new contributors can easily understand the structure and workflows.
